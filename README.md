# Miguel's Introduction to Algorithms and Data Structures.

This repository is a resource for me and anyone interested in starting to learn Algorithms and Data Structures using JavaScript.
I am coming into this fresh and this is purely based on MY understanding. If some of my analogies/notes are wrong feel free to open an issue 
or a pull request to help me fix it. Thank you!
