# My notes on JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures.

This repository is a resource for me as I start to learn Algorithms and Data Structures using JavaScript from Colt Steele.
I am coming into this fresh and this is purely based on MY understanding. If some of my analogies/notes are wrong feel free to open an issue or a pull request to help me fix it. Thank you!

__Each repository represents an entire section, you are not expected to understand it immediately after reading over once so take your time. Each section takes days for me to finish__

This a work in progress.
