# Anagram Challenge

Given two strings, write a function  called validAnagram to determine if the second string is an anagram of the first. 
An anagram is a word, phrase, or name formed by rearranging the letters of another, such as _cinema_, formed from _iceman_.

All the inputs will be single words, you can assume everything is lowercase, there will be no spaces, punctuations, or numbers.

```javascript
validAnagram('', '') //true
validAnagram('aaz', 'zza') //false
validAnagram('anagram', 'nagaram') //true
validAnagram('rat', 'car') //false
validAnagram('awesome', 'awesom') //false
validAnagram('qwerty', 'qeywrt') //true
validAnagram('testtwisttime', 'timetwisttest') //true
```

Try it yourself before going into the [solution](https://github.com/rmdpalo/JS-algorithms-and-data-structures/blob/main/Problem%20Solving%20Patterns/Frequency%20Counter%20Pattern/Anagram-challenge/anagram-solution.js). If you can't figure it out then you can check the solution and revisit this problem again later.
